My name is Brian Muller, and I'm an operator, [investor](/investing), and founder with two exits.

🕵️  I'm currently the Co-founder and CTO of a fintech company currently in stealth mode.

💻 Earlier, I was the CTO and Co-founder of {{< badgelink url=https://parallelmarkets.com img=parallel.png >}}Parallel Markets{{< /badgelink >}} which provided portable investor identity and accreditation services to make investing online easier. Parallel Markets was [acquired by iCapital](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250115839401/en/iCapital%C2%AE-to-Acquire-Parallel-Markets-to-Streamline-Digital-Identity-Investment-Onboarding-and-Compliance-Verification) in early 2025.

📰 Before that, I was the VP of Data and Growth at the magazine {{< badgelink url=https://theatlantic.com img=atlantic.jpg >}}The Atlantic{{< /badgelink >}}, and prior to that I was the Director of Data Science at {{< badgelink url=https://voxmedia.com img=vox.jpg >}}Vox Media{{< /badgelink >}}. At both publications I founded, grew, and led the Data Science and Data Infrastructure teams.

📈 Before that, I was CTO and Co-founder of {{< badgelink url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/opbandit img=opbandit.jpg >}}OpBandit{{< /badgelink >}}, which optimized content on major publishers' sites across 7 countries.  OpBandit was [acquired by Vox Media](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/fa3f68a0-d957-11e4-a8f1-00144feab7de.html) in April of 2015.

🎟️  Prior to that, I ran the Data Science, Data Products, and Data Infrastructure teams at {{< badgelink url=https://livingsocial.com img=livingsocial.jpg >}}LivingSocial{{< /badgelink >}} in Washington, DC.  I was one of the first engineers to join the company (before then starting/leading the various data teams) and saw the company grow from a small startup to one of the first and biggest unicorns of its day.

🇺🇸 Before that I worked as the the Web Director for {{< badgelink url=https://foreignpolicy.com img=foreignpolicy.jpg >}}Foreign Policy Magazine{{< /badgelink >}} in Washington, DC.

🔬 Prior to that I was a research assistant in the {{< badgelink url=https://ccb.jhu.edu img=genomics.jpg >}}Center for Computational Genomics{{< /badgelink >}} at {{< badgelink url=https://www.jhu.edu img=jhu.png >}}Johns Hopkins{{< /badgelink >}} in Baltimore, MD, where I applied machine learning/AI to help make sense of highly complex genetic data.

🎓 Before that I was a graduate student at the {{< badgelink url=https://musc.edu img=musc.jpg >}}Medical University of South Carolina{{< /badgelink >}} in Charleston, SC where I received a MS degree in [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) with a focus on applied [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing).
