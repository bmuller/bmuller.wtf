Hi there! üëã

If you're on this page, then I probably shared the link with you directly to provide more context on who I am and what I'm looking for next.

## Me

> **TL;DR:** I'm a highly technical product / engineering leader, company operator, and former founder with multiple exits. I also have an academic background in ML / AI, and I'm as comfortable running large data science teams as I am leading sizable product / engineering organizations (100+).  I have almost 25 years of experience building products, teams, and companies from the ground up - often starting as the first person within a team or focus area.  My more recent work history and social links can be found [here](/).

My ‚ö°superpower‚ö° is that I can blend strong technical skills (engineering, product, and data science) with business operational experience ([GTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-to-market_strategy), managing large teams, creating/fixing complex business processes, sales/marketing strategy, etc.).

### Role Patterns

Most of my jobs involve taking a company, team, or product from zero to one (and beyond!) as:

 * a startup co-founder, starting with nothing but gumption and a shared mission and creating value for customers, employees, and shareholders
 * the first hire for a new team/focus area within a larger company, where I take a budget and a long term mandate, build teams and processes, and execute
 * the first hire for a new product idea/vertical within a larger company, where I generate a strategy, defend/acquire a budget, build a team and processes, and turn that into net positive revenue
 * a new technical department head brought in to fix a broken team, broken product, broken processes, or some combination

I enjoy each role type equally, and I don't have a preference for any over the others.

### Preferences

 * **Location:** I love "remote-first" environments. That said, in-person work has its own significant benefits and I'm happy to go into an office. I'm based in üóΩ NYC and unlikely to move.
 * **Product Philosophy:** I believe that [empowered product teams](https://www.svpg.com/the-foundation-of-product/) are the most successful.
 * **Management Style:** I operate best when I'm given a planted flag üèÅ and the free reign to create and execute against a strategy to reach objectives.  I prefer to manage people who are looking for the same thing, providing the regular support that they need without excessive monitoring / control. My goal is to foster an environment where reports feel trusted, empowered, and safe enough to feel comfortable being (mutually!) vulnerable. I've been able to consistently recruit previous colleagues and direct reports to come work with me again.
 * **Team Size:** I feel comfortable managing orgs up to around a hundred people in total, and I prefer not to have more than ~7 direct reports.
 * **Coworkers:** I'm happiest at work when I'm surrounded by kind, curious, and highly capable people.
 * **Industry Preference:** Most of my experience is in the fintech, consumer e-commerce, and media/publishing industries - but I love jumping into environments where I don't know anything and quickly leveling up.
 * **Time:** My ideal time üïí mix would include no more than 6 hours a day in meetings (sales, management, strategy, brainstorming, etc.).  I'll be happiest if I have at least a couple of hours a week spent building / designing / testing / evaluating / reviewing code or digital products. I will happily spend as much time talking to customers as they're willing to give me.
 
## You

Ideally, you're a company that is at a [Series A](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/Ek-stages-of-startups#series-a) stage or beyond looking for a technical leader with business and operational experience to take responsibility for a key part of your mission.  You have paying customers who love what you do for them.  Your valuation to revenue multiple is reasonable, or you pay exceptionally well.  Your company culture values employee agency, writing things down, working in the open, and encourages a bias for action (or needs help instituting / fostering one of these). Employees feel safe making mistakes, knowing the company will learn and adapt in a blameless way to increase the resiliency of systems and processes.  People leave meetings thinking their time was well spent.  Employees care about measuring (or at least understanding) the impact of their work on the company, customers, and overall market.
