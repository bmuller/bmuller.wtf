I'm slowly exploring what may come next, and I made this page to more easily communicate who I am and where I may best fit.

### Me
I'm a highly technical product / engineering leader and former founder with multiple exits (more [here](/)) based in ðŸ—½NYC. I also have an academic background in ML / AI and am as comfortable running large data science teams as I am leading sizable product / engineering organizations. I generally agree with [Marty Cagan](https://www.svpg.com)'s view of how product teams should operate. I'm happiest at work when I'm surrounded by kind, curious, and highly capable people.

### You
Ideally, you're a company that is at a [Series A](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/Ek-stages-of-startups#series-a) stage or anywhere beyond.  Most of my experience is in the fintech, consumer e-commerce, energy, and media/publishing industries - but I'm ultimately segment agnostic as long as you're working on hard problems for real customers/users.  I enjoy remote-first work, but am happy to work in an in-person environment (in ðŸ—½ NYC).
